# goculator

`goculator` is born to showcase what can be done with two other projects I maintain:

## stack
- [go-htmx]("https://github.com/donseba/go-htmx") Seamless HTMX integration in golang applications
  - using the basics
  - using SSE (Server Sent Events)
  - using notifications (toasts)
- [expronaut]("https://github.com/donseba/expronaut") A simple expression evaluator
  - using the main Evaluate function to evaluate the string expression from the form

## how to run
- clone the repo
- run `go run main.go` in cmd/server folder
- open your browser at `http://localhost:4321`
- enjoy
